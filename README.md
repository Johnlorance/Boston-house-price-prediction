# Boston-house-price-prediction
Boston house price prediction using linear regression is a method of predicting the price of a house in the Boston area based on a set of predictor variables. Linear
regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this case, the dependent
variable is the house price, and the independent variables are various factors that may influence the price, such as the number of rooms, crime rate, distance to
employment centers, and other socioeconomic factors.

To make a prediction using linear regression, a model is first built using historical data, which includes information on the prices of houses in the Boston area and
the corresponding predictor variables. The model then uses this information to make predictions on the prices of new houses based on their predictor variables.

The linear regression model uses a linear equation that describes the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The equation takes 
the form of y = mx + b, where y is the dependent variable (house price), x is the independent variable (predictor variable), m is the slope of the line (the degree 
to which changes in x affect changes in y), and b is the y-intercept (the value of y when x is zero).

To predict the price of a house in the Boston area using linear regression, data on the relevant predictor variables are collected, and the model is used to 
calculate the predicted house price. The accuracy of the prediction depends on the quality and quantity of the predictor variables used, as well as the accuracy of 
the model.

Overall, Boston house price prediction using linear regression is a useful tool for both buyers and sellers in the Boston area, as it can help inform pricing 
decisions and provide valuable insights into the factors that influence house prices in the area.
